<br /> All living things that live on this earth comes under the environment. Whether they live on land or water they are part of the environment. The environment also includes air, water, sunlight, plants, animals, etc.The environment gives us countless benefits that we can’t repay our entire life. As they are connected with the forest, trees, animals, water, and air. The forest and trees filter the air and absorb harmful gases. Plants purify water, reduce the chances of flood maintain natural balance and many others.
Moreover, the environment keeps a close check on the environment and its functioning, It regulates the vital systems that are essential for the ecosystem. Besides, it maintains the culture and quality of life on earth.The environment regulates various natural cycles that happen daily. These cycles help in maintaining the natural balance between living things and the environment. Disturbance of these things can ultimately affect the life cycle of humans and other living beingsHuman activities are the major cause of environmental degradation because most of the activities humans do harm the environment in some way. The activities of humans that causes environmental degradation is pollution, defective environmental policies, chemicals, greenhouse gases, global warming, ozone depletion, etc.

All these affect the environment badly. Besides, these the overuse of natural resources will create a situation in the future there will be no resources for consumption. And the most basic necessity of living air will get so polluted that humans have to use bottled oxygen for breathing.Above all, increasing human activity is exerting more pressure on the surface of the earth which is causing many disasters in an unnatural form. Also, we are using the natural resources at a pace that within a few years they will vanish from the earth.
To conclude, we can say that it is the environment that is keeping us alive. Without the blanket of environment, we won’t be able to survive.

Moreover, the environment’s contribution to life cannot be repaid. Besides, still what the environment has done for us, in return we only have damaged and degraded it.</p>

<p id="bottom">We truly cannot understand the real worth of the environment. But we can estimate some of its importance that can help us understand its importance. It plays a vital role in keeping living things healthy in the environment.Likewise, it maintains the ecological balance that will keep check of life on earth. It provides food, shelter, air, and fulfills all the human needs whether big or small.Moreover, the entire life support of humans depends wholly on the environmental factors. In addition, it also helps in maintaining various life cycles on earth.
Most importantly, our environment is the source of natural beauty and is necessary for maintaining physical and mental health.Moreover, the earth is considered the only planet in the universe that supports life. The environment can be understood as a blanket that keeps life on the planet sage and sound.People are considered to be the most intelligent creatures on Earth who are able to learn new things in the universe which can lead them to the technological advancement. It goes without saying that there are many benefits in technological development for the economy but it also destroys our environment gradually. We develop technologies and science to make our life better but we do not fall to thinking that it can ruin everything that surround us in the near future. The destructive human activity cause several adverse effects on environment. The effects of pollution are devastative. It is very important to explore the various types of pollution and all possible ways of their prevention in order to make our planet a safe place for the growth and development of all living things.

Water pollution is one of the pivotal problems nowadays. A lot of garbage is thrown directly into the water. Moreover, a lot of factories, mills, and plants discharge the untreated industrial wastes and other unsafe substances into the water bodies. Water is also polluted by fertilizations and pesticides which are widely used in agriculture. The contamination of the living environment leads to the deaths of the entire natural ecosystems. There are many approaches to garbage utilization but most of the poor countries just don`t have enough money to introduce such up-to-date technologies. Air pollution is another humanity`s challenge. The air we breathe has contaminated because of uncontrolled release of harmful vehicular and industrial smokes. Burning fuels, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and chemical vapors are the major pollutants of the air. Sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide cause a situation called Global warming when the radiation is absorbed while the heat is prevented from escaping. Our environment also suffers from noise pollution which has negative effects on people and wild species.</p>
